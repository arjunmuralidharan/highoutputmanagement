High Output Management
by Andy S. Grove

# Introduction
* The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under their supervision or influence.
* The 1:1 meeting is a fundamental tool of management
	* The supervisor can teach their skills and suggest ways to approach things
	* The subordinate can provide details of what they are working on and raise concerns
* You need to retain a competitive advantage to protect your career
	* Are you adding real value and not just passing information?
		* Are you increasing the output of your organization?
	* Are you plugged into what is happening around you?
		* What is happening inside and outside of the organization/company?
	* Are you trying out new ideas?
		* Are you playing with innovative technologies, using them, not just reading about them?

# Ben Horowitz’s foreword

* The manager’s job is to scale – your knowledge is worth nothing unless you can transfer it to the rest of the organization.
* Subordinates can be underperforming for two reasons: Lack of skills or motivation.
* When recognizing gaps, our instinct tells us to close the gap – instead of recognizing that it resulted from a failure to plan in the past.

# THE BREAKFAST FACTORY

## Delivering a Breakfast
* **Principle of production**: To build and deliver products in response to the demands of the customer at a scheduled delivery time, in acceptable quality, and at the lowest possible cost
* **Limiting Step**: The overall shape of your process is defined by the limiting step; which steps take the longest or costs the most? Work backward from that.
* Automating a process comes at the cost of flexibility.

## Managing the Breakfast Factory
* **Indicators**: To run an operation, you need a set of indicators, each focusing on a specific operational goal.
* **Overreacting**: If you focus on one indicator, you will probably overcorrect – you can guard against this by pairing indicators that counteract each other.
* **Output**: A good indicator measures the output, not the activity of a process.
* **Leading Indicators**: Provide a way to predict the final outputs before they happen, given that you can rely on their validity.
* **Productivity**: This can only be increased by working faster or changing the nature of the activity.
* **Leverage**: The output per activity. You want to increase the leverage of your activities. Automation, simplification, and questioning (“why”) can increase the leverage of an activity or process.


# MANAGEMENT IS A TEAM GAME
## Managerial Leverage

* Manager’s output = Output of the organization + output of the neighboring organizations under their influence
	* If _L_ is Leverage, and _A_ is an activity, then:
				
				Output = L1 x A1 + L2 x A2 …
	
	* The sum of the activity outputs, which are determined by the activity’s leverage
* **Managerial activities**: Almost all activities of the manager fall into the following categories.
	* **Information-gathering**
		* **Verbal**: Most useful information comes from verbal exchanges
			* *Written reports*: Valuable only because they force the author to think before approaching you
			* *Visits*: Efficient to visit a location, observe and engage with folks.
	* **Information-giving**
		* Managers convey knowledge, objectives, priorities, preferences – this is key to delegation.
	* **Decision-making**
		* You either make or participate in decisions
		* Two **types of decisions:**
          * Forward-looking decisions
          * Decisions in response to a problem or crisis
	* **Nudging**
		* Conveying a preference on direction – more than information-giving, but less than decision-making / directing.
		* We need to act as role models in the organization in order to nudge folks into certain behaviors
* **Meetings**: They provide occasions for managerial activities. Meetings are the medium, not the activity.
* **Managerial Leverage**: We can increase leverage in three ways:
	* Increase the rate at which activities are performed
	* Increase the leverage of the individual activity
	* Shift the mix from low-leverage to high-leverage activities
* **High Leverage Activities**
	* When a large group is affected by the manager’s activity
	* When the manager’s input affects the employee over a long period of time
	* When a group is affected by the manager providing unique insight or key information
* **Negative Leverage**
	* Failure to plan and untimeliness are crucial to leverage – neglecting these can lead to negative leverage (reducing the output of the group through your involvement)
	* **Waffling**: Lack of decisions are the same as no decision, creating negative leverage
	* **Mood**: Your mood and visible role-model can directly affect the output of the group
	* **Meddling**: Using your knowledge to assume command of a situation rather than letting the subordinate figure it out
* **Delegation as leverage**
	* Delegation only works if the delegator and delegatee have a common information base and notion about solving problems, otherwise the delgatee will always need specific instructions in order to be an effective proxy
	* Holding on to tasks should be a conscious decision; otherwise, it’s meddling
	* Follow-through: You can never fully wash your hands off a task given to you – delegation without follow-through is abdication. You need to monitor what you delegate.
	* Monitoring: Delegated tasks should be monitored at the lowest value-add stage
		* review rough drafts, not near-final reports
		* variable approach: increase or decrease frequency based on the employee’s task-level maturity
		* check-in on details randomly, not for every task
		* Let the subordinate do the work, and then question them in reviews to see if their thinking is sound
* **Increasing the rate of output**
	* **Limiting Step**: Identify the “unmovable” tasks and events, and work around those
	* **Batching**: Group similar tasks together so you reduce setup time; create and maintain re-usable assets
	* **Forecasting**: A manager can forecast and predict their activities; the medium is the calendar
	* **Calendar**: Use it as your production planning tool.
		* Say “no” at the outset to things beyond your capacity.
		* Move towards active use of the calendar, filling in important work in-between your limiting steps.
		* Incorporate slack, some tolerance, and looseness in your production line, so that an unexpected event doesn’t ruin your day
		* Inventory: Maintain a set of projects that you can work on that will increase leverage long-term; this will prevent you from meddling in current work if you find you have time
* **Built-in leverage** in the organization
	* A manager can act as their own subordinate (e.g., lead a group but also act as one of the PMs in the group) to prevent on-the-job retirement and meddling
* **Interruptions**
	* Uncontrolled interruptions are the biggest problem for managers who need to strive towards regularity
	* Identify the most common interruptions, and prepare standard responses
	* Use batching to move interruptions to staff meetings and one-on-ones
	* Make data available quickly to reduce time spent on answering to interruptions
* **Goal:** Impose a pattern to how you deal with problems

## Meetings – the medium of managerial work

* A manager's job includes
  * sharing knowledge
  * imparting a sense of the preferred way of doing things
  * making decisions
* These activities mostyl happen in **meetings**
* We should not fight the existence of meetings, but rather use them efficiently.
* Two basic **types of meetings**:
  * Process-oriented
    * People attending should know how the meeting is run and what is usually discussed
    * Opportunity to "batch" transactions
      * One-on-One
        * Principal way the relationship between manager and subordinate is maintained
        * Venue for mutual teaching and exchange of information
        * Dedicated space to talk about specific problems and situations
        * Frequency depends on the task relevant maturity - how much experience does the employee have in the current role or the task at hand?
        * Frequency also depends on the job area - e.g. how dynamic is the job area and how often do things change in the environment?
        * Duration should be at least 1 hour to allow for deeper discussion and complex problems, otherwise the subordinate 
  * Mission oriented
