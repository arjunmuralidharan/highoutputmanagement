High Output Management
by Andy S. Grove

# Introduction
* The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under their supervision or influence.
* The 1:1 meeting is a fundamental tool of management
	* The supervisor can teach their skills and suggest ways to approach things
	* The subordinate can provide details of what they are working on and raise concerns
* You need to retain a competitive advantage to protect your career
	* Are you adding real value and not just passing information?
		* Are you increasing the output of your organization?
	* Are you plugged into what is happening around you?
		* What is happening inside and outside of the organization/company?
	* Are you trying out new ideas?
		* Are you playing with innovative technologies, using them, not just reading about them?

# Ben Horowitz’s foreword

* The manager’s job is to scale – your knowledge is worth nothing unless you can transfer it to the rest of the organization.
* Subordinates can be underperforming for two reasons: Lack of skills or motivation.
* When recognizing gaps, our instinct tells us to close the gap – instead of recognizing that it resulted from a failure to plan in the past.

# THE BREAKFAST FACTORY

## Delivering a Breakfast
* **Principle of production**: To build and deliver products in response to the demands of the customer at a scheduled delivery time, in acceptable quality, and at the lowest possible cost
* **Limiting Step**: The overall shape of your process is defined by the limiting step; which steps take the longest or costs the most? Work backward from that.
* Automating a process comes at the cost of flexibility.

## Managing the Breakfast Factory
* **Indicators**: To run an operation, you need a set of indicators, each focusing on a specific operational goal.
* **Overreacting**: If you focus on one indicator, you will probably overcorrect – you can guard against this by pairing indicators that counteract each other.
* **Output**: A good indicator measures the output, not the activity of a process.
* **Leading Indicators**: Provide a way to predict the final outputs before they happen, given that you can rely on their validity.
* **Productivity**: This can only be increased by working faster or changing the nature of the activity.
* **Leverage**: The output per activity. You want to increase the leverage of your activities. Automation, simplification, and questioning (“why”) can increase the leverage of an activity or process.


# MANAGEMENT IS A TEAM GAME
## Managerial Leverage

* Manager’s output = Output of the organization + output of the neighboring organizations under their influence
	* If _L_ is Leverage, and _A_ is an activity, then:
				
				Output = L1 x A1 + L2 x A2 …
	
	* The sum of the activity outputs, which are determined by the activity’s leverage
* **Managerial activities**: Almost all activities of the manager fall into the following categories.
	* **Information-gathering**
		* **Verbal**: Most useful information comes from verbal exchanges
			* *Written reports*: Valuable only because they force the author to think before approaching you
			* *Visits*: Efficient to visit a location, observe and engage with folks.
	* **Information-giving**
		* Managers convey knowledge, objectives, priorities, preferences – this is key to delegation.
	* **Decision-making**
		* You either make or participate in decisions
		* Two **types of decisions:**
          * Forward-looking decisions
          * Decisions in response to a problem or crisis
	* **Nudging**
		* Conveying a preference on direction – more than information-giving, but less than decision-making / directing.
		* We need to act as role models in the organization in order to nudge folks into certain behaviors
* **Meetings**: They provide occasions for managerial activities. Meetings are the medium, not the activity.
* **Managerial Leverage**: We can increase leverage in three ways:
	* Increase the rate at which activities are performed
	* Increase the leverage of the individual activity
	* Shift the mix from low-leverage to high-leverage activities
* **High Leverage Activities**
	* When a large group is affected by the manager’s activity
	* When the manager’s input affects the employee over a long period of time
	* When a group is affected by the manager providing unique insight or key information
* **Negative Leverage**
	* Failure to plan and untimeliness are crucial to leverage – neglecting these can lead to negative leverage (reducing the output of the group through your involvement)
	* **Waffling**: Lack of decisions are the same as no decision, creating negative leverage
	* **Mood**: Your mood and visible role-model can directly affect the output of the group
	* **Meddling**: Using your knowledge to assume command of a situation rather than letting the subordinate figure it out
* **Delegation as leverage**
	* Delegation only works if the delegator and delegatee have a common information base and notion about solving problems, otherwise the delgatee will always need specific instructions in order to be an effective proxy
	* Holding on to tasks should be a conscious decision; otherwise, it’s meddling
	* Follow-through: You can never fully wash your hands off a task given to you – delegation without follow-through is abdication. You need to monitor what you delegate.
	* Monitoring: Delegated tasks should be monitored at the lowest value-add stage
		* review rough drafts, not near-final reports
		* variable approach: increase or decrease frequency based on the employee’s task-level maturity
		* check-in on details randomly, not for every task
		* Let the subordinate do the work, and then question them in reviews to see if their thinking is sound
* **Increasing the rate of output**
	* **Limiting Step**: Identify the “unmovable” tasks and events, and work around those
	* **Batching**: Group similar tasks together so you reduce setup time; create and maintain re-usable assets
	* **Forecasting**: A manager can forecast and predict their activities; the medium is the calendar
	* **Calendar**: Use it as your production planning tool.
		* Say “no” at the outset to things beyond your capacity.
		* Move towards active use of the calendar, filling in important work in-between your limiting steps.
		* Incorporate slack, some tolerance, and looseness in your production line, so that an unexpected event doesn’t ruin your day
		* Inventory: Maintain a set of projects that you can work on that will increase leverage long-term; this will prevent you from meddling in current work if you find you have time
* **Built-in leverage** in the organization
	* A manager can act as their own subordinate (e.g., lead a group but also act as one of the PMs in the group) to prevent on-the-job retirement and meddling
* **Interruptions**
	* Uncontrolled interruptions are the biggest problem for managers who need to strive towards regularity
	* Identify the most common interruptions, and prepare standard responses
	* Use batching to move interruptions to staff meetings and one-on-ones
	* Make data available quickly to reduce time spent on answering to interruptions
* **Goal:** Impose a pattern to how you deal with problems

## Meetings – the medium of managerial work

* A manager's job includes
  * sharing **knowledge**
  * imparting a sense of the **preferred way of doing things**
  * making **decisions**
* These activities mostly happen in **meetings**.
* We should not fight the existence of meetings, but rather use them efficiently.
* Two basic **types of meetings**:
  * **Process-oriented**
    * People attending should know how the meeting is run and what is usually discussed
    * Opportunity to **"batch" transactions**
      * **One-on-One**
        * Principal way the **relationship between manager and subordinate** is maintained
        * Venue for **mutual teaching** and **exchange of information**
        * Dedicated space to talk about specific problems and situations
        * Frequency depends on the **task relevant maturity** - how much experience does the employee have in the current role or the task at hand?
        * Frequency also depends on the **job area** - e.g. how dynamic is the job area and how often do things change in the environment?
        * **Duration** should be at least 1 hour to allow for deeper discussion and complex problems, otherwise the subordinate 
  * **Mission oriented**
    * Held ad-hoc and aimed at a specific outcome, often a **decision**
    * **Chairman** often just shows up as an attendee, and meeting fails to achieve intended outcome
    * **Chairman's obligations:**
      * Send invite and pre-empt or follow up to get **commitments** - if someone can't attend, they should send a deputy
      * Ensure a meeting is less than **8 people**, otherwise attendees get passive
      * Don't allow people to be **late**, and call them out
      * Send an **agenda** ahead of the meeting
      * Send **minutes** after the meeting
  * **Meetings are not evil** per se, the real sign of misorganization is if people spend more than 25% of their time in ad-hoc mission-oriented meetings.

## Decisions
* Rapid divergence in knowledge-driven companies between power based on position and power based on knowledge. The middle manager is the link between the two.
* **Ideal model of decision making**
  * *Free discussion*: Allow everyone to speak, and ask those who haven't said anything to contribute - that's why they are in the meeting.
  * *Clear decision*: Make sure to frame the terms of the decision **clearly**.
  * *Full support*: Disagree-and-commit; even if not everyone is on board, ask them to support the decision.
* This method is natural for younger graduates, but **managers struggle** because they fear embarassment if they express their views forcefully.
* Decisions should be always made at the **lowest competent level**, allowing discussion at an equal level at least during the free discussion phase
* *Side note: The lack of status symbols is a feature of tech companies, not a bug, exactly for the above reasons*
* **Peer-group syndrome**
  * Often meetings will wander on without a clear decision being made
  * This can be fixed with the **peer-plus-one** approach, inviting one additional person who is in a higher position to step in if the subordinates cannot reach agreement.
  * Peers often won't stick their neck out, this leads to a danger of *group opinion*, where one member states a weak opinion, which is then restated by a peer more forcefully, and eventually becomes the ruling opinion just because it feels comfortable.
  * The person who has **most at stake** should take charge in meetings, and invite the senior to take over if needed.
* **Optimimum point for decision**
  * A manager strives for the output by finding the optimum point for making a decision.
    * **Too early** if you haven't heard the real issues from everyone
    * **Too late** if the discussion meanders on with no new information
    * Manager needs to have the courage to **force a decision**
* **Six questions** about decisions
  * *What* decision needs to be made?
  * *When* does the decision have to be made?
  * *Who* will decide?
  * *Who* will need to be consulted before and after the decision is made?
  * *Who* will ratify or veto the decision?
  * *Who* will need to be informed of the decision?

## Planning

* General planning process consists of three steps:
  1. Establish a projected need or demand
  2. Establish your present status
  3. Compare and reconcile steps 1 and 2
* The set of actions you decide to close the gap between projection and present is your **strategy**.
* The implementation of these actions are your **tactics**.
* **Management by Objectives**
  * Basically outlines OKRs
    1. Where do you want to go (Objective)?
    2. How will I pace myself to see if I'm getting there (Key Result)?

# TEAM OF TEAMS

## Hybrid Organizations
* Organzations come in two extremes:
  * **Mission-oriented organisations**: Decentralized, each group pursues its own business with little interaction with other groups.
  * **Functional organisations**: Centralized, each group provides a function at scale (Finance, Operations, Merchandising, etc.)
* **Sloan:** "Good management rests on a reconciliation of decentralization and centralization."
* **Grove's Law**: All large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid organizational form.

## Modes of Control
* Behaviour in work environments can be controlled by three invisible and pervasive means
  1. Free-market forces
  2. Contractual obligations
  3. Cultural values
* Free market forces
